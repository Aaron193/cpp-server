The reason I started this project was because I wanted to gain a better understanding of the C++ programming language. (As of Spring 2025) I am taking a college class in C++ and have found its teaching style to not be efficient for learning the language. In my opinion, editing single functions in starter code is not an effective way to become proficient in any language -- and I believe others would agree. I think it is far better to learn how to set up a real project, use external libraries, and build out something that *you* want to make. This is the best way to learn a language or learn programming in general, in my opinion.

So... What is this project? I'm not entirely sure yet. I've gained experience in the past building out multiplayer games, so what better way to learn C++ than to build a game server in it! I wouldn't consider myself a game developer, nor do I have any care to play games. However, I am fascinated by the effort and complexity that goes into building these pieces of software. From networking, physics, rendering, there are so many pieces working in unison, and that's why I love it.
